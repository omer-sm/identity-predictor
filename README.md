# Identity Predictor
hi :) this is my first website with react so its not all that wowzers but its something no????

## How does it work?
after the user enters their name and presses "submit", it sends the name to nationalize.io
when it gets a response, it sends the name with the country to agify.io and genderize.io (both accept countries as input to give more accurate results)
